# Land Registry System using Blockchain

## Overview
The **Land Registry System** is a decentralized application (DApp) built using **Blockchain** technology to securely and transparently maintain the ownership and transfer of land records. This system utilizes blockchain's immutability to eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce fraud in land transactions.

## Features
- **Secure Ownership Tracking**: Land ownership records are stored on the blockchain, ensuring that they cannot be altered or tampered with.
- **Immutable Records**: Once a record is added to the blockchain, it is permanent, offering a verifiable record of land ownership.
- **Efficient Transactions**: Buyers and sellers can conduct land transactions securely without relying on centralized authorities.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automatically enforce the terms of land transactions, ensuring both parties meet their obligations.
- **Decentralized and Transparent**: All transactions are transparent and visible to all network participants, promoting trust and fairness.



## Usage

- **Land Registration**: Users can register land properties by submitting details such as location, area, and ownership.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Buyers and sellers can transfer ownership of land by making transactions that are confirmed by smart contracts.
- **Search Land Records**: Users can search land records by a unique identifier such as land ID.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (using Solidity for smart contract development)
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity
- **Editor**: Remix IDE
